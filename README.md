The group's main focus was lung cancer. We were able to find an article from which we accessed the raw data to apply the bioinformatics pipeline we learned in this workshop. The paper focused on the use of a chemotherapy drug named mitoxantrone to indice senescence to make LUNX protein accessible to the surface of the cell, making it easily targetable by therapies.Our data analysis revealed the same results the researchers got, which makes our analysis job reliable and precise.
